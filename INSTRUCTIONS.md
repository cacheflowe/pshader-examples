# PShader Tutorial WIP Instructions

This is a work-in-progress set of instructions for creating a tutorial on using PShader in Processing. The goal is to cover the basics of shaders, how they work in Processing, and a general introduction to both fragment and vertex shaders for beginners who want to learn how to use shaders effectively in Processing.

## Resources

- We are writing the actual WIP tutorial in PShader_Tutorial.md
- The current outline of topics to cover is in OUTLINE_WIP.md, and this should be updated as the tutorial progresses.
- Refer to the TODO.md and GOOGLE_DOC.md files for notes and ideas of topics to cover. Some of this has already been incorporated into the tutorial, and some is still pending and needs to be thought through.
- There's a style guide for technical documentation that should be followed: DOCS_STYLE_GUIDE.md
- We are writing small example processing files in /sketches to accompany the tutorial, and the code will be placed inline in the tutorial

## Instructions for Writing the Tutorial

1. Use the style guide in DOCS_STYLE_GUIDE.md and the existing content in PShader_Tutorial.md as a reference for tone, style, and formatting.
