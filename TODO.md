# TODO

## Next steps / Editing

- Continue filling out OUTLINE_WIP.md as we write the tutorial in README.md
- Add more screenshots of results
- Adjust uniforms names to have a `u` prefix to indicate they are uniforms
- Make sure examples exactly match the demos in the tutorial
- Standardize capitalization in comments
- The first time a Processing function is mentioned, add a link to the documentation page for it:
  - filter(): https://processing.org/reference/filter_.html
  - PShader.set(): https://processing.org/reference/PShader_set_.html
  - Make a pass through the tutorial and add ticks around keywords and links to reference pages. What's the standard here?
- Apply the [style guide](https://p5js.org/contribute/documentation_style_guide/#unbiased-documentation)


## Questions:

- 🚨 Note: can’t open a .frag or .glsl file in the IDE - how do we recommend editing a glsl file?
  - VS Code w/Processing extension?
- Can I use the example image I found? cool cat? what else could we use here?
  - https://www.freepik.com/free-photo/beautiful-cat-portrait-close-up_19866347.htm
- Ask about punctuation/apostrophes/etc
- Can/should we link to this repo's examples in tutorial?
  - Should more examples be created in the official examples repo in a PShader tutorial section?
- Do we actually need these? `#define PROCESSING_TEXTURE_SHADER`
- Do we need precision specifiers in fragment shaders? `#ifdef precision mediump float; #endif`
